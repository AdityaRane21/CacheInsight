LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache Replacement Algorithm 

We have lines in which we have cache blocks and in these blocks we insert our memory blocks requests
We put elements in the cache untill we have no free space.
As the cache block is full, LRU concept is used, so we have to replace new value with the farthest value in the past.
