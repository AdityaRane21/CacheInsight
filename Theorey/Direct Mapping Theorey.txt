kmodn - k is block number and n is number of lines 
eg) block 0 -0 mod 4, block 0 will go in line 1 

main memory physical address
we require 7 bits to represent 128 words, as 2^7=128
These 7 bits are divided in 2 parts block number (5 bits) and block offset (block size) 2 bits.

cache memory 
block offset remains same 2 bits
block number is divided in 2 parts Tag (3 bits) and Line number (2 bits)

CPU is looking for some word aur voh word ke corresponding block cache me pada hai means cache hit, if not then cache miss.
